# Project State:
## receiving samples
I recevived the samples around Jul-13-2016 for the sparkfun pieces and Jul-19-2016, for the shinyei ppd42ns and MICS 2714
## Testing Parts:
* [Arduino Wifi Shield](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11287) => working.
* [DHT22](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10167) =>  working.
* [BMP180](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11824) => working, but the results are strange. tested another one, getting the same values.
* [SparkFun Luminosity Sensor Breakout - TSL2561](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12055) => working.
* [SparkFun Real Time Clock Module](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12708) => Sadly, not working Update 10/10/2016: a new one is working  .
* [shinyei ppd42ns](http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/images/4/4c/Grove_-_Dust_sensor.pdf) => working, and responding to PM concentration changes.
* [MQ-7 (Carbon Monoxide)](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9403) => It will need an special circuit
* [MQ-131 low concentration (Ozone)](http://www.winsen-sensor.com/products/semiconductor-gas-sensor/sensor-mq131.html) => coming soon
* [MICS 2714]() => it will need an special circuit (and special ensambling)
* [ZE03-CO](http://www.winsen-sensor.com/products/co-module/ze03-co.html) => (thanks to ([Winsen](http://www.winsen-sensor.com/) for the calibration, they made an special 0-50 ppm for US), coming soon
* [ZE03-NO2]() => coming soon.
* [ZE03-SO2]() => coming soon.
