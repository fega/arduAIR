* 1 Arduino (Uno, mega or whatever)
* 1 air Quality sensor (in this category we have a lot of options, like):
 * [MQ sensors]():
	 * [MQ-7](): Carbon Monoxide Sensor
	 * [MQ-131](): An Ozone sensor.
 * Dust optical sensor:
	 * [Shinyei ppd]()
	 * [Plantower PMS 7003]()
	 * [See more references on: AQICN](http://aqicn.org/sensor/)
 *  Alphasense sensors
	 * they have a very expensive sensors, but promises good stability and acuracy, also, they have an excelent costumer service for technical concerns.
	 * [Alphasense NO2 B43F]()
 *  winsen-sensor, another big one. Winser-sensor have a lot of diferent references for every budget, in my experience they have a good costumer service, we bought our sensors here.
	 * NE series
